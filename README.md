## About the Project –

1. This project is the **frontend of a YouTube Clone**, focusing on UI, UX, and client-side functionality.
2. The **Home page** displays a grid of videos fetched from the backend, styled similar to YouTube.
3. A **category filter bar** at the top allows users to filter videos by category (like real YouTube).
4. The **Search bar** supports debounced search and navigates to a search results page.
5. Clicking on a video opens the **Watch page**, which includes:
   - Video playback using **iframe**
   - Video title, views, upload date
   - Like & dislike buttons
   - Channel information
   - Comments section
6. The **Right sidebar on Watch page** shows suggested videos similar to YouTube recommendations.
7. Users can view **any channel page**, which displays:
   - Channel banner, avatar, description, subscribers count
   - All uploaded videos of that channel
8. If a logged-in user views **their own channel**, additional options appear:
   - Create channel (if not exists)
   - Edit channel details
   - Upload new videos
   - Delete uploaded videos
9. Authentication-aware UI:
   - Login & Register pages
   - Logged-in users see profile menu
   - Logged-out users see Sign In option
10. **Dark mode & Light mode** fully implemented using Tailwind CSS.
11. Sidebar behaves like YouTube:
    - Opens/closes via hamburger icon
    - Expanded view shows icons + labels
    - Collapsed view shows icons only
12. A custom **Error Page** gracefully handles invalid routes and unexpected errors.
13. **Lazy loading & code splitting** are implemented using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` with a custom loading component.
14. All pages are fully responsive and optimized for **mobile, tablet, and desktop** screens.
